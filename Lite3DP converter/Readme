This software was created to facilitate the process of converting and saving layer images for 3D printing.

While we plan to create Mac and Linux versions, it is currently only available for windows.

As an alternative to this software, the following steps can be carried out:

1) Unzip the ZIP file from Chitubox. This contains numbered PNG images.
2) Use batch image conversion software to convert all PNG images to 24-bit BMP images. There are many alternatives for MAC and LINUX.
3) Create a folder on the micro SD card and copy all the BMP images there. The name of this folder will appear on the Lite3DP to be selected.
