This software was created to facilitate the process of converting and saving layer images for 3D printing.
While we plan to create Mac and Linux versions, it is currently only available for windows.
As an alternative to this software, the following steps can be carried out:
1) Unzip the ZIP file from Chitubox. This contains numbered PNG images.
2) Use batch conversion software to convert PNG images to 24-bit BMP images.
3) Create a folder on the micro SD card (its name will be the one that will be selected from the Lite3DP) and copy all the BMP images there.
