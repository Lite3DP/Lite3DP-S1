# Calibration Guides

Every resin needs to be calibrated. Even refills of the same resin should be re-calibrated, each and every time. Resins that sit on a shelf for some time, needs to be re-calibrated.

## How do you calibrate a resin?

You print a small calibration piece, over and over again, slightly adjusting the settings until you have a good print.

A Discord member **Maker_JoLam** has [created a scaled down calibration piece](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lite3DP/comments/saofdx/calibration_piece_for_lite3dps1/) that is perfect for the Lite3DP-S1. You can download here in this repo:

_TODO: Create an official guide to calibration and remove "community" links from this fork._
